# LongDozen

_Let users find the nearest place and rate it!_


##
The idea is simple - this site shows you the nearest place you could visit whatever it is (bar, cafe, restaurant), providing the ability to create, update, rate and add to favorites places, register and upgrade user page as well.

This is my pet-project and main purpuse was to put into practice the knowledges of the topics I have learned. 
I have used Django, PostgreSQL with PostGIS extender and some decoration libraries such as Bootstrap, django-leaflet and crispy-django.
